# IpseityArenaUnityMovement
 Basic 1:1 recreation of arena fps style movement such as QuakeWorld, Quake 3: Arena, CPMA, Quake 4, and Warfork with Unity's rigidbody physics system, as well as a basic quake/source engine style console command system.
 Feel free to credit me if you decide to try and use this for some reason.
 Check out Ipseity: Arena on steam and my youtube if you randomly found this :)
